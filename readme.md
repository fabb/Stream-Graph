Stream Graphs with html5 \<canvas\>
=================================

This project features Stream Graph visualizations with html5's \<canvas\> element. It is programmed in JavaScript and works in all modern browsers (tested with Firefox 3.6, 4, 5, Chrome 10, Opera 11, IE 9).

It was made by Barbara Csarman and Fabian Ehrentraud for the course "Informationsvisualisierung" on the University of Technology Vienna.


Note
----

Due to security reasons most browsers need the html file to be loaded from a real web server and not a local file. The two function calls send() (on the XMLHttpRequest object) and getImageData() otherwise will lead to an error.
